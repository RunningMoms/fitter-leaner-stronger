                    I am in my 50's, college age kids so it is my time. Running, calorie deficit was not working. The
                    strengthening program along with eating properly and reducing inflammation has totally changed my
                    body.
                    I eat more now than I did in college playing varsity sports and I do not believe I am eating enough!

                    which
                    has happened before and I can run on the days I run. After 2 months I am strong and fit. I believe
                    the
                    weight will slowly come off in the next few months, slowly and properly but i am not obsessed with

                    Carey Adam I listened to the first and second podcast so far, I've said it before &hellip; you speak
                    my
                    language. I've been on a self improvement journey for the last couple of years but I didn't join
                    this
                    group thinking it would improve my "self" this way. I joined because I was injured and had committed
                    to
                    running a half marathon and needed help to get there. Yet here I am 3 months later I am stronger
                    both
                    mind and body, I feel good about my self in all aspects. I've noticed improvements not only in the
                    physical but also the emotional and mental health. My body is changing, slimming down, muscle
                    building,
                    skin clearing etc.

                    Today I did a 4 mile HITT run. When I joined this group I was struggling with longer distances. My
                    hormones were burnt out, I was having issues with my lungs and just wasn't enjoying it. I kept
                    pushing
                    myself because l believed that if I worked harder it would get better and easier. After having a one
                    on
                    one call with Carey, she convinced me that "stronger not longer" was my better mantra. I slowly
                    embraced
                    the lower mileage and really ramped up the HITT training and glute workouts. I started watching what
                    I
                    eat, portion sizes and really trying to get more water. I suddenly saw a change in my body, my runs
                    became easier and more fun, and I'm feeling better. My original goal when I started running over two
                    years ago was to get in shape. Finally after two years I have the body I want and the mindset to go
                    with
                    it. This program has been instrumental in helping me make changes. I consult the member website at
                    least
                    once a week for a new recipe, training tip or just encouragement. Thank you Carey.

                    From I have loved the last 4 weeks! I have two young kids who love to play with me and I was so sick
                    of
                    waking up hurting every morning! I have wanted to get my fitness back so badly the last few years
                    and
                    even though I cycle a lot, I couldn't get back to the workouts I used to do (to gain muscle) without
                    hurting my back even worse. These workouts have been amazing and my back already feels so much
                    better!
                    The nutrition was/is something that I needed to work on and I'm so thankful for being able to do
                    that
                    here. It's just an all around win and I'm so freaking excited to keep this up!

                    I love how vastly different I feel on every level: physically, mentally, psychologically, and
                    spiritually. Life has been so stressful and I was a hormonal mess in the midst of this pandemic.
                    Signing
                    up for this program was the smartest choice I've ever made. My health has drastically changed for
                    the

                    appreciation and gratitude for rest days. I've developed healthier habits that I intend on keeping

                    the rest of my life. I am truly changed and grateful that I kind of stumbled into this community by
                    fluke. I had such a great and easy run this morning, truly enjoying and so in tune with the
                    movement.
                    I'm in love with this lifestyle and I'm grateful for this community as well as Carey and Alex's
                    wisdom

                    Before I started this program I was training for a half marathon. Got all the way up to completing a
                    15k
                    &amp; then developed runners knee in my left knee. It was disheartening but I researched &amp;
                    learned I
                    wasn't training properly at all &amp; needed to be strength training. So I did some research which
                    brought
                    me to this group. This 28 day challenge has honestly been life changing. It taught me the proper way
                    to
                    train &amp; nourish and I'm happy to say that today I ran my fastest 5k yet. I'm officially back on
                    track to train for that half marathon again &amp; this time I know I'll succeed because I'm doing it
                    the
                    right way. Thank you so much Carey Adam &amp; Alexandra Chicoine! Because of you, I'm going to crush
