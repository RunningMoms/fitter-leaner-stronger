        I had to end the week STRONG, and before 9AM (Texas Heat). Did a run
        w/burst and the 5-4-3-2-1 (| missed earlier in the week). Nourished,
        hydrated, FEEL ABSOLUTELY STRONG AND AMAZING! Thank you Carey
        and Alexandra Chicoine!! I truly have not felt this stable (physically) in
        years!!
