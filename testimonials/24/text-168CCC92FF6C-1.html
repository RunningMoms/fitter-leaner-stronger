        Honestly Michelle, this program has been
        transformative for me. I am in my 50's, college age kids so it is
        my time. Running, calorie deficit was not working. The
        strengthening program along with eating properly and reducing
        inflammation has totally changed my body. I eat more now than I
        did in colege playing varsity sports and I do not believe I am
        eating enough! In 2 months I have not lost much weight but I
        have lost inches everywhere, I have not gotten injured which has
        happened before and I can run on the days I run. After 2 months I
        am strong and fit. I believe the weight will slowly come off in the
        next few months, slowly and properly but i am not obsessed with
        it -I am strong and healthy!!!
