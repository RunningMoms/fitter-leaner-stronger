        Day 3: DONE! V This mama
        NEEDED that core workout! I feel stronger, andI was mindful to
        meet my body where it is without judgment. I am going to put
        these core exercises into my weekly rotation. I can't wait to see
        the strength and changes my body will gain by doing these
        exercises consistently! I did an easy 30 minute run after, and I'm
        feeling great!
