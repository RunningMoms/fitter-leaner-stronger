        Today I did a 4 mile HITT run.
        When I joined this group I was struggling with longer distances. My
        hormones were burnt out, I was having issues with my lungs and just
        wasn't enjoying it. I kept pushing myself because l believed that if I
        worked harder it would get better and easier. After having a one on one
        call with Carey, she convinced me that "stronger not longer" was my
        better mantra. I slowly embraced the lower mileage and really ramped up
        the HITT training and glute workouts. I started watching what I eat,
        portion sizes and really trying to get more water. il suddenly saw a
        change in my body, my runs became easier and more fun, and I'm feeling
        better. My original goal when I started running over two years ago
        was to get in shape. Finally after two years I have the body I want and
        the mindset to go with it. This program has been instrumental in helping
        me make changes. I consult my member website at least once a week
        for a new recipe, training tip or just encouragement. Thank you Carey.
