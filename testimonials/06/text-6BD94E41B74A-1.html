        Before I started this program I was training for a half marathon. Got all
        the way up to completing a 15k & then developed runners knee in my left
        knee. It was disheartening but I researched & learned I wasn't training
        properly at all & needed to be strength training. So I did some research
        which brought me to this group. This 28 day challenge has honestly been
        life changing. It taught me the proper way to train & nourish and I'm
        happy to say that today I ran my fastest 5k yet. I'm officially back on
        track to train for that half marathon again & this time I know I'll succeed
        because I'm doing it the right way. Thank you so much Carey Adam &
        Alexandra Chicoine! Because of you, I'm going to crush this goal!
