        and in love Thank you Carey Adam
        Crushed Iit in the workout! 3 rounds after a 15 minute run....I
        loved this one!! My nutrition is on track. No cravings, no
        impulsive snacking. I'm %on track with it. I feel amazing!
        Love this program!! Getting amazing results!! And I wake up
        loving my body more each day!! I've been on a fitness journey for
        8 years. I originally weighted 210lbs. I lost tons of weight but
        struggled with toning and adding definition. Ive done program
        after program. I've been a beachbody coach, done meal
        supplements, in essence, tried everything. Spent thousands of
        dollars. This is by far my favourite program ever!! I'm hooked
